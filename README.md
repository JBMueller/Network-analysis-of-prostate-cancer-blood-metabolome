# Network analysis of prostate cancer blood metabolome
 
This repository was created as part of the course MSB1014: Network Biology taught at Maastricht University within the Systems Biology Master programme. 
This repository contains an R script to analyze metabolomics data published by Benedetti et al. found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02750-7. In short the analysis performs correlation network inference, Girvan-Newman community detection on large components, extraction of small components and then visualization of components unique to either cancer or non-cancer samples.
